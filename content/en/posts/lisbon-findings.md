# My Favorite Places around Lisbon (so far)

Welcome to my ongoing guide to the best spots in the Lisbon region! Living around here for a while, I've had the privilege of exploring some of its nooks and crannies and discovering some hidden gems along the way. But let's face it, there's always a chance I'll forget a few of my favorite spots when someone asks me for recommendations. So, I've decided to document my top picks for food, drink, and sightseeing in one convenient place. Let's get started before my forgetful brain kicks in.

## For eating:
- Tasca do Chico

## For drinking:
- Groove Bar

## For admiring the view:
- [Miradouro da Senhora do Monte](https://www.facebook.com/miradourodasenhordomonte/)
