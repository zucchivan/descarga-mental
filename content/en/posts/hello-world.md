## Hello, World!

If you are able to read this text it means I won a battle against procrastination and deployed a small place to host my daily mind dumps (or weekly, or monthly... stop pressuring me).

Around here I will write a little bit about any kind of shit that bothers me: from silly software development topics that nobody really cares to weird takes on geopolitics.

This blog was developed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), _a static site generator written in Go_, and is probably only happening because due to the facility of being able to write in Markdown language ‚ù§Ô∏è and having a CLI (command line interface) that manages boring stuff for me. It is my ideal chance to empty my mind, interact with the Golang ecosystem (as we already had an unresolved love in the past) and also keep my Github timeline alive _~~(IT recruiters love that, even though it doesn't mean much)~~_.

That's just what I have for initial post, now I need to figure out how to deploy this thing on Github Pages in the painless way possible. See you!

_**atualiza√ß√£o*:_ to setup the deployment workflow was ridiculously easy and absolutely painless, thankfully. üí´
